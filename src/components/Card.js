// main logic of the game
// images for cards
// sorting for cards at start of the game
// all the click events for the cards

// user clicks on 1st card
// flip card
// leave card flipped
// user clicks on second card
// flip card
// check card images - if 1st card same as 2nd card image, leave cards flipped
// if images are different, flip both cards back over 
// repeat until no more cards left to be flipped

// use one card and dynamically populate our cards
// how do i pass props into a functional component?
// with an argument 

import React from 'react'
